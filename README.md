# Build a Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP or food stamps) Eligibility Pre Screener




## Challenge Outline

1. Before the event, connect with a local CBO partner that does SNAP application assistance. This will likely be your local Food Bank but many other organizations do this work, too. Learn how they currently screen clients for SNAP eligibility and if a SMS or online screener would be useful. Invite them to the event!
  * Here are some general guidelines on SNAP eligibility:  http://www.fns.usda.gov/snap/eligibility

2. During the event, start with some research
  * Figure out who is eligible for SNAP in your state. Keep in mind the following groups who should be able to determine their eligibility:
      * Elderly (people over 60)
      * Undocumented
      * Students
      * People with disabilities
  * Here is pre-screening resource to consider how you might model your questions: http://www.snap-step1.usda.gov/fns/
  * Talk to your CBO partner to figure out what screening questions are most relevant to the populations they serve.
  * Talk to your CBO partner about documents one must bring for caseworker interview
  * Bonus - figure out how to estimate how much each person qualifies for

3. Write a SNAP screener!
  * Fork this sample codebase and write a screener for your target population (either web or SMS)
  * Document your code, including notes about state specific policies
  * Buy a twilio number, deploy to heroku, and test it out!

4. Share it with us and the world! (screenshot + Tweet + PR + blog?)
  * Add your code to this repo SNAP screeners across the nation - https://github.com/mRelief/mrelief_snap_screeners
