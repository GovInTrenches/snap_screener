# Build a Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP or food stamps) Eligibility Pre Screener

On February 20-22nd, mRelief (www.mrelief.com) will be part of a national event in partnership with Code For America (CFA) to build upon our work as the first Social Services Delivery SMS application for screening eligibility in the US. mRelief is a midwest based web and SMS application led by an all-woman web development team that helps users check their eligibility for public assistance. CFA organizes a network of people dedicated to making government services simple, effective, and easy to use.

We invite users all across the nation to participate in a challenge to build a food stamps eligibility pre-screeners for a target population.  We also encourage meaningful collaboration with non-technical experts in the field engaged in food policy and advocacy.

## Challenge Outline

1. Before the event, connect with a local CBO partner that does SNAP application assistance. This will likely be your local Food Bank but many other organizations do this work, too. Learn how they currently screen clients for SNAP eligibility and if a SMS or online screener would be useful. Invite them to the event!
  * Here are some general guidelines on SNAP eligibility:  http://www.fns.usda.gov/snap/eligibility

2. During the event, start with some research
  * Figure out who is eligible for SNAP in your state. Keep in mind the following groups who should be able to determine their eligibility:
      * Elderly (people over 60)
      * Undocumented
      * Students
      * People with disabilities
  * Here is pre-screening resource to consider how you might model your questions: http://www.snap-step1.usda.gov/fns/
  * Talk to your CBO partner to figure out what screening questions are most relevant to the populations they serve.
  * Talk to your CBO partner about documents one must bring for caseworker interview and the best responses for eligible and ineligible users
  * Bonus - figure out how to estimate how much each person qualifies for

3. Write a SNAP screener!
  * Fork this sample codebase and write a screener for your target population (either web or SMS)
    * If you decide to build an SMS screener, here is a link to Twilio's documentation - https://www.twilio.com/docs/
    * A 2010 report by Frost and Sullivan revealed that nearly everyone (90% of U.S. adults) has access to texting, more than any other communication medium.
  * Document your code, including notes about state specific policies
  * Buy a twilio number, deploy to heroku, and test it out!

4. Share it with us and the world! (screenshot + Tweet + PR + blog?)
  * Add your code to this repo SNAP screeners across the nation - https://github.com/mRelief/mrelief_snap_screeners
