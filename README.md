# Build a Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP or food stamps) Eligibility Pre Screener




## Challenge Outline

1. Before the event, connect with a local CBO partner that does SNAP application assistance. This will likely be your local Food Bank but many other organizations do this work, too. Learn how they currently screen clients for SNAP eligibility and if a SMS or online screener would be useful. Invite them to the event!

2. During the event, start with some research
- Who is eligible for SNAP in your state?
- Talk to your CBO partner to figure out what screening questions are most relevant to the populations they serve.

3. Write a SNAP screener!
- Fork this sample codebase and write a screener for your target population
- Document your code, including notes about state specific policies
- Buy a twilio number, deploy to heroku, and test it out!

4. Share it with us and the world! (screenshot + Tweet + PR + blog?)
- Add your code to this repo SNAP screeners across the nation - https://github.com/mRelief/mrelief_snap_screeners
