# Build a Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP or food stamps) Eligibility Pre-Screener

On February 20-22nd, mRelief (www.mrelief.com) will be part of a national event in partnership with Code For America (CFA) to build upon our work as the first Social Services Delivery SMS application for screening eligibility in the US. mRelief is a midwest based web and SMS application led by an all-woman web development team that helps users check their eligibility for public assistance. CFA organizes a network of people dedicated to making government services simple, effective, and easy to use.

We invite users all across the nation to participate in a challenge to build a food stamps eligibility pre-screeners for a target population.  We also encourage meaningful collaboration with non-technical experts in the field engaged in food policy and advocacy.
